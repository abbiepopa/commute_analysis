# commute_analysis

I wanted to learn how long I spent on the BART commuting to and from work. This notebook digests my Clipper Card report pdf,
which I downloaded from clippercard.com, into a format where I can compare my time spent commuting in and out.

One interesting finding, is that even though I "salmon" in the evening on the way home, my commute is about the same length, 
likely due to their being more trains in the direction I'm going.
